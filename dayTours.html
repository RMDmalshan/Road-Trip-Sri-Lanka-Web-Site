      <td width="500" height="183"><p>Sigiriya is a historic rock stronghold in Dambulla, Matale, Central Sri Lanka, that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Climbing the massive rock formation's 1200 stairs for a stunning perspective of the lush jungle beneath is one of the greatest things to do there. When you're through with Sigiriya, camp nearby and head over to Pidurangala Rock, which is right next door, for another amazing climb.</p></td>
      <td width="500"><p>The next location in this list is one of the most interesting spots in Sri Lanka, and it is incredibly distinctive and lovely in every way. We're discussing the Temple of the Tooth Relic. This temple is quite popular, and most tourists visiting Sri Lanka come here primarily for its uniqueness. This, like many other prominent Sri Lankan destinations, is listed as a world heritage site by UNESCO. The temple is both spiritual and historically significant.</p></td>
      <td width="500"><p>Yala National Park is the place to go if you want to go on a safari in Sri Lanka. The enormous park, which is full of forests and wildlife and is a sanctuary for elephants, crocodiles, leopards, and hundreds of different bird species, is located in southeast Sri Lanka on the edge of the Indian Ocean. Yala National Park, on the other hand, is known for its leopards! There are numerous old and destroyed Buddhist monasteries further inland where you might make a pilgrimage. </p></td>

    <tr>
      <td width="500" height="183">If you're a true adventurer, you won't want to miss out on hiking the spectacular Sri Pada, also known as Adam's Peak or Butterfly Mountain. Adam's Peak, the fourth tallest peak in Sri Lanka, is located in northeastern Ratnapura. A mystical rock formation at the summit of its 2244m is said by many locals to be either Siddhartha Gautama's footprint or the first footprint of Adam, the first man. The hike takes approximately 3 hours to complete and is best done between December and May when the weather is pleasant.</td>
      
      <td width="500"> Mirissa is the major fishing port on the island's south shore, located on the island's southernmost point. It's not difficult to get to because of its beauty and proximity to Colombo (the capital city). The capital's airport is about a two-hour drive away. The small beach town and its vast beach are both lovely, with a dense grove of palm trees surrounding them. The settlement is located on a little hill behind the beach. Mirissa Beach is formed like an arrow, with the arrow tip protruding into the water. The surf is also calmer and safer to swim because of the natural jetty. The sea is incredibly pure, and the beaches are dazzling white with smooth, fine sand. Where the bottom is sandy, it's bright green, and where there are rocks or reefs, it's dark blue. Mirissa is also an excellent site to go whale watching, which is best done between February and March.</td>
      
      <td width="500">Again, we're talking about Sri Lanka, which is a lovely, peaceful, and religious location. This is yet another community, this time called Kandalama. This ensures that the experience you will have here cannot be duplicated anywhere else on the planet. This is a location where you can take a ride to the skies. Yes, you read that correctly. A hot balloon service is available here, which will carry you high above the clouds. This is without a doubt one of Sri Lanka's most beautiful locations. </td>

      <td width="500" height="183">Horton Plains National Park must be included on any list of the greatest locations to visit in Sri Lanka. A vacation to the Horton Plains is highly recommended for individuals who appreciate being in nature and trekking. The hike's endpoint is the world's end, from which you may enjoy the otherworldly vistas. The park also has misty waterfalls, lovely lakes, and diverse flora and fauna.</td>
      
      <td width="500"> Sinharaja Forest Reserve should be included in any ranking of Sri Lanka's most beautiful sites. If there is one thing that Sri Lanka has in plenty, it is flora and animals. Sinharaja Forest Reserve, home to lions, is a haven for wildlife aficionados and nature lovers, making it one of Sri Lanka's top tourist destinations. This location is worth seeing because it is home to a variety of endemic birds and mammals.</td>
      
      <td width="500">Arugam Bay is stunning, with sparkling white sand and deep blue water that gradually turns green as you get closer to the shore. The beach is recognized as a worldwide surf destination because of its attractiveness, which includes some of Sri Lanka's top surf breaks. This reputation not only attracts a large number of people but also indicates that the area has a well-developed tourist infrastructure and is easily accessible. The curving beach has a Hawaiian feel to it, with a dry, sandy section near the ocean, then rougher areas with plants and a tree line. Nearby attractions include ancient temples and Kumana National Park, which is notable for the many types of birds that dwell in or migrate through the area. </td>

Sri Lanka was once a colony of both Portugal and Holland (at various times), and this was the country's capital at the time. Unawatuna, just five kilometers outside of Galle, is another small slice of beach heaven. The area, also a big destination for ecotourism, has a large coral reef offshore. The beach is large and curving but can be crowded as it's considered one of the country's best beach resorts.</td>
      
      <td width="500"> Do you enjoy peering into the past of the location you're visiting on vacation? As one must dive into the history to understand the present, why don't you visit the National Museum of Colombo, which was founded in 1877 and houses a large collection of historical items that tell the heritage of this lush green country and is one of the most famous places in Sri Lanka.</td>
      
      <td width="500">Explore the city of Galle with personalized attention from your guide on this private tour. You'll enjoy a comprehensive tour focused on your interests, with commentary tailored to your group. Visit the Galle Fort, take in the architecture of the town, and visit Unawatuna Gay for swimming and snorkeling. Easy round-trip transportation makes for a door-to-door experience. </td>
