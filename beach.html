      <td width="500" height="183"><p> Mirissa is the major fishing port on the island's south shore, located on the island's southernmost point. It's not difficult to get to because of its beauty and proximity to Colombo (the capital city). The capital's airport is about a two-hour drive away. The small beach town and its vast beach are both lovely, with a dense grove of palm trees surrounding them. The settlement is located on a little hill behind the beach. Mirissa Beach is formed like an arrow, with the arrow tip protruding into the water. The surf is also calmer and safer to swim because of the natural jetty. The sea is incredibly pure, and the beaches are dazzling white with smooth, fine sand. Where the bottom is sandy, it's bright green, and where there are rocks or reefs, it's dark blue. Mirissa is also an excellent site to go whale watching, which is best done between February and March.</p></td>
      
      <td width="500"><p>Nilaveli Beach is a wide, sandy beach with palm trees and fishing boats dotted about. It's a 30-minute drive from the city of Trincomalee in the northeastern area of Sri Lanka. If Nilaveli's seclusion isn't enough, take a boat to Pigeon Island, approximately a half-mile off the coast. Due to its small reef, this tiny island features tranquil beaches with modest waves.Despite its size, Nilaveli's beach is popular with both locals and tourists. There are lifeguards on duty, as well as numerous small restaurants along the beach, the most of which specialize in seafood.</p></td>
      
      <td width="500"><p>On Pasikudah Bay, this mile-long beach is ideal for swimming and wading. The waves are calm, and the beach is shielded by a reef (many beaches in Sri Lanka have very rough surf). The water is very shallow, allowing you to stroll out hundreds of yards into the ocean. The beach is bordered with coconut trees, and the sand is dazzlingly white and silky with fine grains. This area is only now being found as a potential location for luxury resort development. It is located directly on the beach at Pasikuda, the larger beach town adjacent to Kalkudah Beach. Kalkudah is located on the east coast, approximately 15 miles north of Batticaloa. </p></td>

    <tr>
 
      <td width="500" height="183"><p>Arugam Bay is stunning, with sparkling white sand and deep blue water that gradually turns green as you get closer to the shore. The beach is recognized as a worldwide surf destination because of its attractiveness, which includes some of Sri Lanka's top surf breaks. This reputation not only attracts a large number of people but also indicates that the area has a well-developed tourist infrastructure and is easily accessible. The curving beach has a Hawaiian feel to it, with a dry, sandy section near the ocean, then rougher areas with plants and a tree line. Nearby attractions include ancient temples and Kumana National Park, which is notable for the many types of birds that dwell in or migrate through the area.</p></td>
      
      <td width="500"><p>Unawatuna and its beach area close to Galle, a historical town with plenty of sites to explore. Sri Lanka was once a colony of both Portugal and Holland (at various times), and this was the country's capital at the time. Unawatuna, just five kilometers outside of Galle, is another small slice of beach heaven. The area, also a big destination for ecotourism, has a large coral reef offshore. The beach is large and curving but can be crowded as it's considered one of the country's best beach resorts.</p></td>
      
      <td width="500"><p>Negombo is a lovely little village vibe within an hour from Colombo and not far from the airport. The beach, which caters to tourists, features a beachfront lined with eateries and small stores selling handicrafts. Bands and musicians perform along the beach, adding to the lively atmosphere. Beach chair and umbrella rentals are offered from enterprising residents on the large and level beach.

      <td width="500" height="183"><p>The colors of Angle, on the southern coast, make for stunning Instagram shots. The light sand contrasts sharply with the dark blue ocean, both set against the beach's lush green flora. The beach edge, like many other beaches in Sri Lanka, is lined by a dense grove of trees. The beach is fluffy, light gold-colored sand at the top, with a sharp rise at the waterline. The Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort is a beachfront luxury property with villa accommodations. Near Tangalle, there's a new resort area close to the country's huge, recently opened seaport.</p></td>
      
      <td width="500"><p>Bentota is a popular tourist destination about an hour's drive from Colombo. Although it attracts a large number of package tourists, it retains its magnificent natural beauty and is well worth a visit. On this large beach, the sand is dazzling white, and the sea is bright aqua-blue due to the light-colored sandy bottom. The beach is flanked by huge palm palms and rainforests. Many temples and remains of the country's colonial past, such as a fort defending Galle's old harbor, are nearby attractions.</p></td>
      
      <td width="500"><p>Hikkaduwa is a beach in the southwest of Sri Lanka, adjacent to Galle and about 95 kilometers from Colombo, that is known for its heavy surf and good surfing. The beach is typical of those seen in Sri Lanka, with lush vegetation and palm palms lining the shore. The sea has a brilliant turquoise color, and the sand is fine and white. Behind the beach area is a national park. It's one of the country's only three marine national parks, with its coral sanctuary. The park is also recognized for its sea turtles and fish, in addition to the coral.
